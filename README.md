# So, my friend is a big kpop fan.

Naturally, I can't be bothered to interest myself in those kinds of matters. However, I always had one single burning question in my head.

What does BTS stand for? 

Yeah yeah, there's probably some dumb answer to that on google, I heard it stands for some wierd stuff in korean, but I'm not korean and I refuse to take the easy way out of things.

Right now, this project is hosted at https://whatdoesbtsstandfor.sites.tjhsst.edu

If this makes it to the big list of websites on https://www.theuselesswebindex.com/, I'd be super pumped.
